mooncake_store_keys.py
----------------------
Single source of truth for Mooncake-store key suffixes used across the
FlexKV <-> mooncake-store integration.

Two suffixes are defined:

* ``KV_SUFFIX``       - full KV-cache blocks (default FlexKV traffic).
* ``INDEXER_SUFFIX``  - DSA indexer side-car blocks (one per main KV
  block, identical block-id namespace, separate Mooncake worker).

A helper ``build_key(block_hash, suffix)`` is provided to make the
key-construction explicit at call sites.

    """Build a Mooncake-store key from a block hash and a pool kind.

    Key suffix policy (driven by the *node-local* CPU pool layer range):

    * Single-node deployment (any ``pp_size``): the per-node CPU pool covers
      the *full* model layer set, so the on-the-wire block is bitwise
      identical to a PP=1 deployment's block. No suffix is appended,
      letting single-node PP=1 / PP=2 / PP=4 instances share keys and
      hit each other's cache.

    * Cross-node PP (node only holds part of the model): suffix is
      ``_pp_rank_<i>_of_<N>`` so that different PP topologies (e.g.
      2-node PP=2 vs 4-node PP=4) do NOT alias each other - their
      per-node layer slices have different lengths and would yield
      bitwise-incompatible blocks under the same key.

    Determination of "single-node" is done from the *layer range* the
    node's CPU pool covers, not from ``pp_size`` directly, because
    single-node PP>1 deployments still get a full-model CPU pool
    (see PR #171 / ``num_layers_on_node`` in ``transfer_manager.py``).
