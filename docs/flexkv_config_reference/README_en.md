# FlexKV Configuration Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to configure and use FlexKV's online service configuration file (`flexkv_config.json`), covering the meaning of all parameters, recommended values, and typical usage scenarios.

---

## Basic Configuration Options

### 1. Configuration via Config File

If the `FLEXKV_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is set, the configuration file specified by this variable will be used with priority. Both yml and json file formats are supported.

Below is a recommended configuration example that enables both CPU and SSD cache layers:

YML configuration:
```yml
cpu_cache_gb: 32
ssd_cache_gb: 1024
ssd_cache_dir: /data/flexkv_ssd/
enable_gds: false
```
Or using JSON configuration:
```json
{
  "cpu_cache_gb": 32,
  "ssd_cache_gb": 1024,
  "ssd_cache_dir": "/data/flexkv_ssd/",
  "enable_gds": false
}
```
- `cpu_cache_gb`: CPU cache layer capacity in GB, must not exceed physical memory.
- `ssd_cache_gb`: SSD cache layer capacity in GB. Recommended to be greater than `cpu_cache_gb` and a multiple of `FLEXKV_MAX_FILE_SIZE_GB`. Set to 0 if only using CPU cache (SSD cache will not be enabled).
- `ssd_cache_dir`: Directory where SSD cache data is stored. If multiple SSDs are available, separate multiple mount paths with semicolons `;`. For example, `ssd_cache_dir: /data0/flexkv_ssd/;/data1/flexkv_ssd/` to improve bandwidth.
- `enable_gds`: Whether to enable GPU Direct Storage (GDS). If hardware and drivers support it, enabling this can improve SSD to GPU data throughput. Disabled by default.

### 2. Configuration via Environment Variables

If the `FLEXKV_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is not set, configuration can be done through the following environment variables.

> Note: If `FLEXKV_CONFIG_PATH` is set, the configuration file specified by `FLEXKV_CONFIG_PATH` will take priority, and the following environment variables will be ignored.

| Environment Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `FLEXKV_CPU_CACHE_GB` | int | 16 | CPU cache layer capacity in GB, must not exceed physical memory |
| `FLEXKV_SSD_CACHE_GB` | int | 0 | SSD cache layer capacity in GB. Recommended to be greater than `FLEXKV_CPU_CACHE_GB` and a multiple of `FLEXKV_MAX_FILE_SIZE_GB`. Set to 0 if only using CPU cache (SSD cache will not be enabled) |
| `FLEXKV_SSD_CACHE_DIR` | str | "./flexkv_ssd" | Directory where SSD cache data is stored. If multiple SSDs are available, separate multiple mount paths with semicolons `;`. For example, `"/data0/flexkv_ssd/;/data1/flexkv_ssd/"` to improve bandwidth |
| `FLEXKV_ENABLE_GDS` | bool | 0 | Whether to enable GPU Direct Storage (GDS). If hardware and drivers support it, enabling this can improve SSD to GPU data throughput. Disabled by default, set to 1 to enable |

## Advanced Configuration Options
Advanced configuration is mainly for users who need fine-tuned performance optimization or custom special requirements. It is recommended for users with some understanding of FlexKV.
All advanced configurations support configuration via environment variables or yml/json configuration files. In case of conflicts with multiple configuration levels, the final priority order is: **Configuration file > Environment variables > Built-in default parameters**.
If setting in a configuration file, remove the `FLEXKV_` prefix and convert everything to lowercase. For example, setting `server_client_mode: 1` in a yml file will override the value of the `FLEXKV_SERVER_CLIENT_MODE` environment variable.
Some configurations can only be set through environment variables.

### Enable/Disable FLEXKV

> Note: This configuration can only be set through environment variables

| Environment Variable | Type | Default | Description |

### CPU-GPU Transfer Optimization

| Environment Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|---------------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `FLEXKV_USE_CE_TRANSFER_H2D` | bool | 0 | Whether to use cudaMemcpyAsync for Host→Device transfers. Can avoid occupying SM, but transfer speed will be reduced |
| `FLEXKV_USE_CE_TRANSFER_D2H` | bool | 0 | Whether to use cudaMemcpyAsync for Device→Host transfers. Can avoid occupying SM, but transfer speed will be reduced |
| `FLEXKV_TRANSFER_NUM_CTA_H2D` | int | 4 | Number of CUDA thread blocks (CTAs) used for H2D transfer, only effective when `FLEXKV_USE_CE_TRANSFER_H2D` is 0 |
| `FLEXKV_TRANSFER_NUM_CTA_D2H` | int | 4 | Number of CUDA thread blocks (CTAs) used for D2H transfer, only effective when `FLEXKV_USE_CE_TRANSFER_D2H` is 0 |
| `FLEXKV_TRANSFER_PATH_OPT` | bool | 1 | Enable the CE optimized five-path adaptive strategy. `0` = baseline (`PER_BLOCK` per-block memcpy, no optimization, for benchmarking); `1` = optimized paths (`CONTIG_DIRECT` / `SEGMENT_DIRECT` / `SEGMENT_SCATTER` / `GATHER_SCATTER` / `GATHER_DIRECT` auto-select, **default**). Only effective when `FLEXKV_USE_CE_TRANSFER_H2D` or `FLEXKV_USE_CE_TRANSFER_D2H` is 1 |
| `FLEXKV_TRANSFER_SEGMENT_THRESHOLD` | int | 8 | Segment count threshold for `SEGMENT_DIRECT` vs `GATHER_SCATTER` selection (only when `FLEXKV_TRANSFER_PATH_OPT=1`). **Only effective for LAYERFIRST scenarios** (non-contiguous segments ≤ threshold → `SEGMENT_DIRECT`, otherwise → `GATHER_SCATTER`). BLOCKFIRST scenarios always use `GATHER_DIRECT` and are not affected by threshold. Use `microbenchmark_ce_threshold.py` to find the optimal value for your workload |
| `FLEXKV_MLA_D2H_MODE` | str | "rank_rotate" | **Only applicable to MLA scenarios** (kv_heads=1, all TP ranks have identical KV). Controls how CPU KV Cache is written during D2H transfer. Available options:<br/>• `rank_rotate` - **Default**. Rotates the designated rank that writes the complete KV per request, avoiding sustained single-rank overload that causes thermal throttling; best with CE<br/>• `sharded` - Each GPU writes 1/N shard to form one complete KV (requires `chunk_size % num_gpus == 0`)<br/>• `all_write` - Each GPU writes complete KV to its own location (N× CPU memory)<br/>• `rank0_only` - Only rank 0 writes complete KV<br/>• `layer_parallel` - Writes in parallel by layer |
| `FLEXKV_ENABLE_MEMCPY2D` | bool | 0 | `SEGMENT_SCATTER` / `GATHER_DIRECT` path selection (effective for both D2H and H2D). `0` = **Default**, uses staging buffer + CPU scatter/gather (works on all platforms, best on P800); `1` = uses `cudaMemcpy2DAsync` for strided direct transfer (~58ms on NVIDIA H20, but extremely slow 12.8s / ~200× worse on P800/Kunlunxin). Only effective when CE transfer is enabled and path 2 `SEGMENT_SCATTER` or path 4 `GATHER_DIRECT` is selected; other paths (CONTIG_DIRECT / SEGMENT_DIRECT / GATHER_SCATTER) are unaffected |
| `FLEXKV_LAYERWISE_NOTIFY_MODE` | str | "hostfunc" | Notification mechanism used by layerwise H2D transfer to signal the inference engine after each layer batch completes:<br/>• `hostfunc` - Default. Uses `cudaLaunchHostFunc` to enqueue a host callback on the CUDA stream; fires precisely when the GPU finishes the batch<br/>• `polling` - A background thread polls per-batch CUDA events via `cudaEventQuery` and writes the eventfd as soon as all GPUs complete each batch. Avoids the cross-thread scheduling overhead of `cudaLaunchHostFunc`; benchmarked faster than `hostfunc` on NVIDIA 8x GPU (e.g. cuda engine: small 0.60→0.40ms 1.50x, medium 4.39→1.87ms 2.35x, large 16.79→16.62ms 1.01x). Costs one busy-polling CPU thread per `LayerwiseTransferGroup` instance |

### SSD I/O Optimization

> Note: Setting `iouring_entries` to 0 disables iouring. Not recommended to set to 0.

| Environment Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|---------------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `FLEXKV_MAX_FILE_SIZE_GB` | float | -1 | Maximum size of a single SSD file, -1 means unlimited |
| `FLEXKV_IOURING_ENTRIES` | int | 512 | io_uring queue depth. Recommended to set to `512` to improve concurrent I/O performance |

---

### Tracing and Debugging

| Environment Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|---------------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `FLEXKV_ENABLE_TRACE` | bool | 0 | Whether to enable performance tracing. Recommended to disable (`0`) in production to reduce overhead |

### Control Plane Optimization

| Environment Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|---------------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `FLEXKV_INDEX_ACCEL` | bool | 1 | 0-Enable Python version RadixTree implementation, 1-Enable C++ version RadixTree implementation |
| `FLEXKV_EVICTION_POLICY` | str | "lru" | Cache eviction policy, options: "lru", "lfu", "fifo", "mru", and "filo". "lru" means Least Recently Used, "lfu" means Least Frequently Used, "fifo" means First In First Out, "mru" means Most Recently Used, "filo" means First In Last Out |
| `FLEXKV_EVICT_RATIO` | float | 0.05 | CPU and SSD eviction ratio for proactive eviction per cycle (0.0 = only evict the minimal necessary blocks). Recommended to keep at `0.05`, i.e., evict 5% of least recently used blocks per cycle |
| `FLEXKV_EVICT_START_THRESHOLD` | float | 0.7 | Memory utilization threshold to trigger proactive eviction. When the cache utilization reaches this ratio, FlexKV starts evicting nodes proactively. For example, `0.7` means eviction begins when 70% of the cache is occupied. Set to `1.0` to only evict when the cache is full |
| `FLEXKV_HIT_REWARD_SECONDS` | int | 0 | Number of bonus seconds added to a node's effective access time on each cache hit, enhancing LRU with frequency awareness. When set to `0` (default), standard LRU behavior applies. When set to a positive value, frequently hit nodes accumulate extra protection time, making them harder to evict. See [Eviction Policy Guide](../eviction_policy/README_en.md) for details |
